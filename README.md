# Resolving `aten::std_mean.correction` Error in PyTorch on Apple M3 with MPS Backend

The error message indicates that the operation `<code>aten::std_mean.correction</code>` from PyTorch cannot run on the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend on your M3 MacBook and falls back to the CPU instead. Here’s an explanation of the issue and potential solutions.

---

## 1. What Does `<code>aten::std_mean.correction</code>` Mean?

`<code>aten::std_mean.correction</code>` is a specific operation in PyTorch. **"Aten"** is PyTorch’s internal library that provides mathematical and statistical functions. This operation calculates the **mean** and **standard deviation** of tensors (data structures used in machine learning). The term **correction** refers to an adjustment applied during standard deviation calculations to minimize bias.

## 2. The Role of PyTorch and the MPS Backend

PyTorch is a widely used machine learning library that supports GPUs to accelerate computations. Apple developed the **MPS backend** to access GPUs in its Apple Silicon chips (e.g., M1, M2, M3) via Metal. This allows faster execution of neural networks on Apple devices. However, operations like `<code>aten::std_mean.correction</code>` are not fully supported on MPS, so PyTorch falls back to the CPU, which is slower.

---

## 3. Why is the Function Unsupported on MPS?

The **MPS backend** in PyTorch is relatively new and under development. Apple and PyTorch continue working to support more operations for MPS. Some operations, like `<code>aten::std_mean.correction</code>`, have not been fully implemented yet, forcing PyTorch to default to the CPU.

---

## 4. Optimization on CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs

CUDA is a parallel computing framework developed by NVIDIA for its GPUs. Machine learning tools, including PyTorch, are optimized for CUDA, which supports a wide range of operations, including `<code>std_mean.correction</code>`. On NVIDIA GPUs, these computations run efficiently on the GPU, avoiding fallback to the CPU.

---

## 5. Why Doesn't It Run on MPS and What Can Be Done?

Apple’s MPS backend does not support CUDA, as CUDA is exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs. Instead, MPS offers a GPU acceleration framework, but it still lacks complete support for certain PyTorch operations.

### Possible Solutions:

1. **Alternative Implementations**  
   Use a different library or method if your code heavily relies on `<code>std_mean.correction</code>`.

2. **Await Future PyTorch Updates**  
   PyTorch is improving MPS support; future versions might fully support this operation.

3. **Optimize CPU Performance**  
   For operations that fall back to the CPU, optimize your code for better performance on Apple’s M3 chip.

4. **Manual Replacement**  
   Replace occurrences of `<code>torch.std</code>` and `<code>torch.std_mean</code>` with **separate computations** for `<code>torch.std</code>` and `<code>torch.mean</code>`. This avoids the CPU fallback and allows computations to remain on the GPU.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Manual Replacement of `<code>torch.std_mean</code>`



### 1. Locate the `<code>torch.std_mean</code>` Call

In the source file (e.g., `anisotropic.py`), look for the line:
### Step-by-Step Guide to Adjustment

1. **Open the file `anisotropic.py`:**

   - Find the line where `torch.std_mean` is used. In your output, the line might look something like this:

   ```python
   s, m = torch.std_mean(g, dim=(1, 2, 3), keepdim=True)


- **Replace `torch.std_mean` with separate `torch.std` and `torch.mean` calculations**:
  - Change the line into two separate calls for `torch.std` and `torch.mean`, like this:

    ```python
    s = torch.std(g, dim=(1, 2, 3), keepdim=True)
    m = torch.mean(g, dim=(1, 2, 3), keepdim=True)
    ```

- This change calculates the standard deviation and mean separately, thus avoiding CPU fallback since torch.std and torch.mean are supported on MPS.
---

- **Save and test**:
  - Save the changes in `anisotropic.py` and restart Fooocus.
  - Check if the warning for `aten::std_mean.correction` disappears and observe if inference speed improves.

---

By splitting the calculations into separate operations for mean and standard deviation, the computation can remain entirely on the GPU, potentially improving performance significantly.

---

### Why this adjustment works:

The combined `torch.std_mean` call is not fully supported on the MPS architecture (Apple Silicon) and causes the CPU fallback. By splitting the operations into `torch.std` and `torch.mean`, you ensure that the calculations remain fully on the MPS GPU, as these two operations are supported separately on MPS.


 
*Der Fehler tritt auf, weil aten::std_mean.correction von MPS nicht unterstützt wird und daher auf die CPU zurückfällt.
 
CUDA und NVIDIA-GPUs bieten eine bessere Unterstützung für eine breite Palette von Operationen, die auf Apple Silicon noch eingeschränkt sind.
 
Mögliche Lösungen umfassen alternative Berechnungsstrategien oder Abwarten auf zukünftige PyTorch-Updates, die mehr Unterstützung für MPS bieten könnten.
